# Python-Applications
In this repo, I plan to maintain some quick py app. ready to be imported to code.

Uploaded some of my old projects too.

1. Spell Corrector:

This app. could be used to correct misplelled words from the text corpus. I have used the Levenshtein edit_distance to find out the one edit away correct word.  (have used both one edit and two edits away correct word).
The app. can be directly imported to your code, and can be applied to the text corpus.
